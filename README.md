# Coding Problems Repository

Welcome to my coding problems repository! This repository contains solutions to various coding problems I've tackled, organized into folders based on different topics. All solutions are implemented in Java.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured into folders, each representing a specific topic. Each folder contains multiple Java files, each representing a solution to a specific problem. The problem statement is typically included in the comments at the top of each file.

## How to Use

To run a solution:
1. Navigate to the appropriate folder.
2. Open the desired Java file.
3. Include the necessary code in the main application file located at `/Users/vikyathshirva/DEV/Java/INTV/src/main/java/MainApp.java`.
4. Compile and run the `MainApp.java` file using a Java compiler.

### Example

```java
// MainApp.java

package main.java;

import arrays.SomeArrayProblem;

public class MainApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SomeArrayProblem solution = new SomeArrayProblem();
        solution.solve(); //or some method that is the entry point
    }
}

```
## Adding More Solutions

I will be continuously adding more problems and their solutions to this repository. Stay tuned for updates!
